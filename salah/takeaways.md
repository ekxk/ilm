## Khutbah: How to Make The Most of your Salah by Dr. Omar Suleiman[^1]

- Salah: gain closeness to Allah swt. Softening the heart. 
- [Al-'Ankabut: 45](https://quran.com/29?startingVerse=45): "Recite that which has been revealed to you of the book and **establish the prayer**. Verily the prayer forbids. It stops you. It forbids you from falling into al-fahsha'i wal-munkar."
- These 5 prayers are the greatest gift from Allah swt. Treat them right. Honor them.
- A salah is like a flowing river in front of your home, cleanses oneself five times a day. [Sahih Muslim 668](https://sunnah.com/muslim:668)
  - Bath in a flowing river, deep, immersed anyone. Enough for anyone who need it. Near. Of course the masjid is there but essentially it is near us, anywhere accessible. 
- Salah = **A dhikr with all of our body**.
