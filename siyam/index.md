Notes on As-Siyam (the fasting).


> In a narration by Muslim, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said,
> "The reward of every (good) deed of a person is multiplied from ten to seven hundred times.
> Allah (SWT) says: 'The reward of observing Saum is different from the reward of other good deeds;
> Saum is for Me, and I Alone will give its reward.
