## Train your nafs in shaban [^1]

- *Hubb ad dunya*: loving anything that is worldly that gets in the way of where you want to be in the hereafter. Anything that holds you in this worldly perspective from the best version of yourself. It can be money, your ego, friends, attachment.
- *Mukhalafat-i nafs*: opoosition of the lower self nafs. To oppose the self. Lower self vs higher aspiration of the self. To make the doors of shaytan shrink and eventually no way in. Spiritually conditioned yourself for the sake of Allah swt. Intentionally make yourself uncomfortable for the sake of Allah swt. For example,
  - you want to get that extra 20 minutes sleep, or wake up?
  - When your lower self said, don't send that text message and reconciliate, but you send it.
  - When you want to stay silent, but Allah swt told you to speak up the truth. 
- Tear your soul and let it rest.
- There's a process even for the Prophet saw, to get to that point of capacity.
- Ramadhan is the arena. Shaban (before ramadhan) is the training camp.
- Everything you do in this month will affect something about Ramadhan. Every single good habit you cultivate in Sha'ban will have an impact in Ramadhan. And every single bad habit that you leave unremedied in Sha'ban will impact you negatively in Ramadhan.
- Daily task in Sha'ban: find a thing today that is Mukhalafat-i nafs.
